\chapter*{Preface}

These are notes for a reading course under Professor \href{https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/index.html}{Dave Anderson}.
They begin with a review of some material from Fulton's \emph{Young Tableaux}\footnote{which throughout these notes will be spelled as ``tableaux'' or ``tableau'' with no real consistency.}~\cite{book:YT}.
However, the primary focus is Manivel's \emph{Symmetric Functions, Schubert Polynomials, and Degeneracy Loci}~\cite{book:ManivelSFSPDL} which one could see as a quasi-sequel.

\chapter{\cite{book:YT} Geometry}

\begin{sol}[\cite{book:YT} \S 9.1 Ex. 1]\label{ex:YT_9.1.1}
  Choose a basis $\set{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{m}}$ so that $E$ can be identified with $\C^{m}$.
  Let $i_{1} < \cdots < i_{d - 1}$ and $j_{1} < \cdots j_{d + 1}$ be sequences in $[m]$.
  Apply \S 9.1 Equation (1) with $k = 1$ to the sequences $j_{2} < \cdots < j_{d + 1}$ and $i_{1} < \cdots < i_{d - 1}, j_{1}$ by fixing $j_{1}$ to be the vector swapped successively with the $j_{2} < \cdots < j_{d + 1}$.
  Reordering the indices and applying the appropriate sign change yields the desired alternating summation.
\end{sol}

\begin{sol}[\cite{book:YT} \S 9.1 Ex. 2]\label{ex:YT_9.1.2}
  We have that $V \subseteq E = \C^{4}$ is given as the kernel of multiplication of a matrix $A = (a_{i, j})_{\substack{1 \leq i \leq 4 \\ 1 \leq j \leq 2}}$.
  To find this matrix, the given conditions of the $x_{i, j}$ describe the following determinantal conditions on the entries of $A$:
  \begin{align*}
    x_{1, 2} = 1 &\iff \Delta_{1, 2}(A) = 1, \\
    x_{1, 3} = 2 &\iff \Delta_{1, 3}(A) = 2, \\
    x_{1, 4} = 1 &\iff \Delta_{1, 4}(A) = 1, \\
    x_{2, 3} = 1 &\iff \Delta_{2, 3}(A) = 1, \\
    x_{2, 4} = 2 &\iff \Delta_{2, 4}(A) = 2, \\
    x_{3, 4} = 3 &\iff \Delta_{3, 4}(A) = 3.
  \end{align*}
  From here, we must make an assumption based on which affine portion of $\mathbb{P}^{5}$ our matrix lives in.
  This amounts to picking some $i_{1}, i_{2}$ so that the minor given by those columns is the identity matrix.
  For the given conditions, we could pick $(i_{1}, i_{2}) = (1, 2)$, $(1, 4)$, or $(2, 3)$.
  We give $A$ for each of these choices respectively:
  \begin{align*}
    A =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & -1 & -2 \\
      0 & 1 & 2 & 1
    \end{pmatrix},
    &&
    A =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 2 & 1
    \end{pmatrix},
    &&
    A =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      2 & 1 & 0 & -3 \\
      -1 & 0 & 1 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{align*}
  It is clear that these are the same matrix up to row operations.

  Following~\cite[Corollary of Theorem 1, \S 8.1]{book:YT}, we have that $S^{\bullet}(m; d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s})$ is canonically isomorphic to the subalgebra of $\C[Z]$ generated by all $D_{T}$, where $T$ varies over all tableaux on Young diagrams whose columns have lengths in $\set{d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}}$ and entries in $[m]$ where
  \[
    D_{T} = \prod_{j = 1}^{\ell} D_{T(1, j), T(2, j), \ldots, T_{\mu_{j}, j}}
  \]
  where $\mu_{j}$ is the length of the $j\textsuperscript{th}$ column of $\lambda$ the shape of $T$ and $\ell = \lambda_{1}$.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item We mimic the proof of~\cite[Proposition 2, \S 9.1]{book:YT}.
          \quest{I think this proof needs to be rewritten.}
          Let $G = G(d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}) \leq \GL(V)$.
          The dimension of the vector space of polynomials of homogeneous polynomials of degree $a$ in the span of all the $D_{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{p}}$ for $p \in \set{d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}}$ is $\sum d_{\lambda}(m)$ where the sum ranges over all partitions of $a$ of shape $\lambda$ with columns whose lengths lie in $\set{d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}}$.
          Viewing $V^{\oplus m}$ by identifying $Z_{i, j}$ with the $i\textsuperscript{th}$ basis vector of the $j\textsuperscript{th}$ copy of $V$, we have by~\cite[Corollary 3(a), \S 8.3]{book:YT} that $\C[Z]_{a} = \Sym^{a}(V^{\oplus m}) \simeq \bigoplus_{\lambda \vdash a} (V^{\lambda})^{d_{\lambda}(m)}$ where $\lambda \vdash a$ has at most $n$ rows.
          Thus, we would like to show that $(V^{\lambda})^{G}$ has dimension $1$ when the lengths of the columns of $\lambda$ lie in $\set{d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}}$ and $0$ otherwise.

          We recall the construction of $V^{\lambda}$ in \S 8.1 of~\cite{book:YT}.
          Elements of $V^{\times \lambda}$ are specified by specifying an element of $V$ for each box in $\lambda$.
          Fillings by basis vectors $\set{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}}$ corresponding to semistandard Young Tableaux $T$ of shape $\lambda$ with entries in $[n]$.
          The images of such elements in $V^{\times \lambda}$ in $V^{\lambda}$ form a basis $\set{e_{T}}$ of $V^{\lambda}$.
          Consider the basis element corresponding to the tableaux $U(\lambda)$ given by filling every box on row $i$ with the number $i$.
          For maps in $G$, the first $d_{i}$ basis vectors must map to linear combinations of the first $i$ basis vectors and the restrictions of such maps to the $V_{i}$ have determinant $1$.
          As such, we can only consider $\lambda$ whose columns have lengths lying in $\set{d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}}$.
          To see that $e_{U(\lambda)}$ is the only such fixed basis vector,
