\chapter*{Preface}

At the time of writing this, I am starting my PhD at The Ohio State University.
Currently a large part of my interests in algebra are about algorithms as they relate to polynomials and algebraic geometry.
I've been doing a bunch of problems from \emph{Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms}~\cite{book:IVA}.
However,  it seems that \emph{Using Algebraic Geometry}~\cite{book:UAG} moves through the material faster as it assumes you know more algebra.
So I've moved onto working through this book as well as trying to comprehend Sturmfel's \emph{Algorithms in Invariant Theory}~\cite{book:AlgosInInvTheory}.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Polynomials and Ideals}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.1]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $x^{2} \in \ideal{x - y^{2}, xy}$ in $k[x, y]$.
    \item Show that $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy, y^{2}} = \ideal{x, y^{2}}$.
    \item Is $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy} = \ideal{x^{2}, xy}$? Why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{pf}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We have that $x(x - y^{2}) + y(xy) = x^{2} - xy^{2} + xy^{2} = x^{2}$.
    \item It suffices to check for generators.
          We have that $x + (-1)(y^{2}) = x - y^{2}, y(x) = xy$, and $y^{2} = y^{2}$ showing that $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy, y^{2}} \subseteq \ideal{x, y^{2}}$.
          Then $x - y^{2} + y^{2} = x$ and $y^{2} = y^{2}$ shows the reverse containment and overall the ideals are equal.
    \item We already know from 1.\ that $x^{2}$ lives in $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy}$.
          Since $xy = xy$, we overall have that $\ideal{x^{2}, xy} \subseteq \ideal{x - y^{2}, xy}$.
          It remains to check if $x - y^{2} \in \ideal{x^{2}, xy}$.
          However, notice that every element of $\ideal{x^{2}, xy}$ is divisible by $x$ while $x - y^{2}$ is clearly not divisible by $x$.
          Thus $x - y^{2} \notin \ideal{x^{2}, xy}$ and the two ideals are not equal.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{pf}
