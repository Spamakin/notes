\chapter*{Preface}

At the time of writing this, I am starting my PhD at The Ohio State University.
Currently a large part of my interests in algebra are about algorithms as they relate to polynomials and algebraic geometry.
I've been doing a bunch of problems from \emph{Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms}~\cite{book:IVA}.
However,  it seems that \emph{Using Algebraic Geometry}~\cite{book:UAG} moves through the material faster as it assumes you know more algebra.
So I've moved onto working through this book as well as trying to comprehend Sturmfel's \emph{Algorithms in Invariant Theory}~\cite{book:AlgosInInvTheory}.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Polynomials and Ideals}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.1]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.1}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $x^{2} \in \ideal{x - y^{2}, xy}$ in $k[x, y]$.
    \item Show that $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy, y^{2}} = \ideal{x, y^{2}}$.
    \item Is $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy} = \ideal{x^{2}, xy}$? Why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{pf}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item We have that $x(x - y^{2}) + y(xy) = x^{2} - xy^{2} + xy^{2} = x^{2}$.
    \item It suffices to check for generators.
          We have that $x + (-1)(y^{2}) = x - y^{2}, y(x) = xy$, and $y^{2} = y^{2}$ showing that $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy, y^{2}} \subseteq \ideal{x, y^{2}}$.
          Then $x - y^{2} + y^{2} = x$ and $y^{2} = y^{2}$ shows the reverse containment and overall the ideals are equal.
    \item We already know from 1.\ that $x^{2}$ lives in $\ideal{x - y^{2}, xy}$.
          Since $xy = xy$, we overall have that $\ideal{x^{2}, xy} \subseteq \ideal{x - y^{2}, xy}$.
          It remains to check if $x - y^{2} \in \ideal{x^{2}, xy}$.
          However, notice that every element of $\ideal{x^{2}, xy}$ is divisible by $x$ while $x - y^{2}$ is clearly not divisible by $x$.
          Thus $x - y^{2} \notin \ideal{x^{2}, xy}$ and the two ideals are not equal.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.2]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.2}
  Show that $\ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$ is closed under sums in $k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$.
  Also show that if $f \in \ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$ and $p \in k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$ then $p \cdot f \in \ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  Let $f, g \in \ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$.
  Then $\exists p_{1}, \ldots, p_{s}, q_{1}, \ldots, q_{s}$ such that $f = \sum_{i = 1}^{s} p_{i} \cdot f_{i}$ and $g = \sum_{i = 1}^{s} q_{i} \cdot f_{i}$.
  Thus $f + g = \sum_{i = 1}^{s} (p_{i} + q_{i}) \cdot f_{i}$ which shows that $f + g \in \ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$.
  Then let $p \in k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$.
  We have that $p \cdot f = p\sum_{i = 1}^{s} p_{i} f_{i} = \sum_{i = 1}^{s} (p \cdot p_{i}) \cdot f_{i}$ which shows that $\ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$ is an ideal.
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.3]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.3}
  Show that $\ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$ is the smallest ideal containing $\set{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  We already know that $\ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$ is an ideal by \Cref{ex:UAG_1.1.2}.
  Now suppose that $J$ is an ideal containing $\set{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$.
  Then, since ideals are closed under addition and scaling, we have that for all $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{s} \in k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$ that $\sum_{i = 1}^{s} p_{i} \cdot f_{i} \in J$.
  Thus, $\ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}} \subseteq J$.
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.4]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.4}
  Using \Cref{ex:UAG_1.1.3}, formulate and prove a general criterion for the equality of $I = \ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}}$ and $J = \ideal{g_{1}, \ldots, g_{t}}$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  We claim that $\ideal{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}} = \ideal{g_{1}, \ldots, g_{t}}$ if and only if $\set{g_{1}, \ldots, g_{t}} \subseteq I$ and $\set{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}} \subseteq J$.
  The forward implication is immediate.
  Then by \Cref{ex:UAG_1.1.3}, if $\set{g_{1}, \ldots, g_{t}} \subseteq I$ then $J \subseteq I$.
  Similarly, $\set{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{s}} \subseteq J \implies I \subseteq J$ and overall $I = J$.
  This fact was used in \Cref{ex:UAG_1.1.1} (b).
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.5]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.5}
  Show that $\ideal{y - x^{2}, z - x^{3}} = \ideal{y - x^{2}, z - xy}$ in $\Q[x, y, z]$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  It suffices to show that $z - x^{3} \in \ideal{y - x^{2}, z - xy}$ and and $z - xy \in \ideal{x - y^{2}, z - x^{3}}$.
  Indeed we have that $(z - xy) + x(y - x^{2}) = z - x^{3}$ which also yields that $z - xy = z - x^{3} - x(y - x^{2})$.
\end{pf}

\clearpage

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.6]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.6}
  Show that every ideal $I \subseteq k[x]$ is generated by a single polynomial.
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  If $I = \set{0}$ then $I = \ideal{0}$.
  So suppose $I \neq 0$.
  Let $d \in I$ be of minimal degree.
  \quest{$d = \gcd(I)$ but I need infinite Bezout.}
  Then we claim that $\ideal{d} = I$.
  Since $d \in I$, we have that $\ideal{d} \subseteq I$.
  Now let $f \in I$.
  By Euclidean division, there exists $q, r \in k[x]$ such that $f = qd + r$ where either $r = 0$ or $0 \leq \deg(r) \leq \deg(d) - 1$.
  If $r = 0$ then $f \in \ideal{d}$ and we are done.
  So suppose $r \neq 0$.
  Then $f, qd \in I \implies r = f - qd \in I$.
  Thus, $r \in I$ is of degree strictly less than $d$, contradicting the minimality of the degree of $d$.
  So we must have that $r = 0$ and overall $\ideal{d} = I$.
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.7]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.7}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $\sqrt{\ideal{x^{n}}} = \ideal{x}$ in $k[x]$.
    \item If $p(x) = (x - a_{1})^{e_{1}} \cdots (x - a_{m})^{e_{m}}$, find $\sqrt{\ideal{p(x)}}$.
    \item Let $k = \C$.
          What are the radical ideals in $\sqrt{\C[x]}$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Suppose $f(x) \in \ideal{x}$.
          Then $f(x)^{m} \in \ideal{x^{n}}$ so $f(x) \in \sqrt{\ideal{x^{n}}}$
          Now suppose that $f(x) \in \sqrt{\ideal{x^{n}}}$.
          Then $\exists k$ such that $f(x)^{k} \in \ideal{x^{n}}$.
          Thus $f(x)^{k}$ is a multiple of $x^{n}$.
          This implies that $f(x)^{k}$ is a multiple of $x$.
          Then notice that the unique factorization of $f(x)^{k}$ into irreducibles is the $k$th power of the factorization of $f(x)$ into irreducibles.
          Thus $x$ must be a factor of $f(x)$ and so $f(x) \in \ideal{x}$.
          Note, this heavily uses the fact that $k[x]$ is a unique factorization domain for all fields $k$.
    \item We claim that $\sqrt{\ideal{p(x)}} = \ideal{(x - a_{1}) \cdots (x - a_{m})} = I$.
          Suppose $f(x) \in I$.
          Let $k = \max{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}}$.
          Then $p(x) \mid f(x)^{k}$ so $f(x) \in \sqrt{\ideal{p(x)}}$.
          Now suppose that $f(x) \in \sqrt{\ideal{p(x)}}$.
          Then $\exists k$ such that $f(x)^{k} \in \ideal{p(x)}$.
          Thus $f(x)^{k}$ is a multiple of each $(x - a_{i})$.
          Then notice that the unique factorization of $f(x)^{k}$ into irreducibles is the $k$th power of the factorization of $f(x)$ into irreducibles.
          Thus $f(x)$ is a multiple of each $(x - a_{i})$ and so $f(x) \in I$.
    \item Radical ideals are the ideals $I$ such that $\sqrt{I} = I$.
          Notice that $\C[x]$ is a principal ideal domain and so any such $I$ must be generated by a single polynomial.
          Since every polynomial in $\C[x]$ splits into linear factors, (b) immediately implies that the only radical ideals of $\C[x]$ are the ones which are of the form $\ideal{(x - a_{1}) \cdots (x - a_{m})}$ for $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m} \in \C[x]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{pf}

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.8]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.8}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Show that a prime ideal is radical.
    \item What are the prime ideals in $\C[x]$?
          What about the prime ideals in $\R[x]$ or $\Q[x]$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal in $k[\overline{x}]$.
          Clearly $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq \sqrt{\mathfrak{p}}$ always.
          Let $f(\overline{x}) \in \sqrt{\mathfrak{p}}$.
          Then $f(\overline{x})^{m} \in \mathfrak{p}$ for some $m \in \Z_{\geq 1}$.
          We prove the reverse inclusion by induction on $m$.
          If $m = 1$ then $f(\overline{x}) =f(\overline{x})^{1} \in \mathfrak{p}$.
          Now let $m > 1$ and suppose the claim holds for all $k \leq m$.
          Then suppose $f(\overline{x})^{m + 1} \in \mathfrak{p}$.
          Then $f(\overline{x}) \cdot f(\overline{x})^{m} \in \mathfrak{p}$/
          Either $f(\overline{x}) \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $f(\overline{x})^{m} \in \mathfrak{p}$ which by induction implies that $f(\overline{x}) \in \mathfrak{p}$.
          Thus, $f(\overline{x})^{m} \in \mathfrak{p} \implies f(\overline{x}) \in \mathfrak{p}$ for all $m \in \Z_{\geq 1}$ and so $\sqrt{\mathfrak{p}} \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$.
          Thus, all prime ideals are radical.
    \item Notice that for all fields $k$ that $k[x]$ is a principal ideal domain.
          Thus, all the prime ideals are the ones generated by a single irreducible polynomial.
          Also, in $k[x]$ we have that $(0)$ is a prime ideal as well as $k[x]$ is an integral domain.
          In $\C[x]$, these are the ideals generated by $x - z$ for some $z \in \C$.
          In $\R[x]$, the primes are the ideals generated by $x - r$ for some $r \in \R$ or $x^{2} + r$ for some positive $r \in R$.

\begin{exercise}[\tcite{book:UAG} 1.1.9]\label{ex:UAG_1.1.9}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Show that $\ideal{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}}$ is maximal in $k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$.
    \item Show that for any point $(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}) \in k^{n}$ that $\ideal{x_{1} - a_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} - a_{n}}$ is maximal in $k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$.
    \item Show that $\ideal{x^{2} + 1}$ is maximal in $\R[x]$.
          Is $\ideal{x^{2} + 1}$ maximal in $\C[x]$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{pf}
  \begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item First, observe that $\ideal{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}}$ is the ideal consisting exactly of polynomials which have no constant term.
          Let $I$ be an ideal in $k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$ such that $\ideal{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}} \subsetneq I$.
          Thus there exists $f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) \in I \setminus \ideal{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}}$.
          We have by our observation that $f$ has a nonzero constant term $z$.
          Then note that the non-constant terms of $f$ form a polynomial $g(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n})$ in $\ideal{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}}$.
          Thus, we have that $z = f(x) - g(x) \in I$.
          Since $I$ contains a nonzero constant term, we must have that $I = k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$.
    \item Recall that an ideal $I$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field.
          Let $I = \ideal{x_{1} - a_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} - a_{n}}$.
          Consider the evaluation map $\text{ev}_{\overline{a}}\colon k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}] \to k$ sending $f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) \mapsto f(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n})$.
          Clearly this map is surjective.
          Certainly we have that $I \subseteq \ker(\text{ev}_{\overline{a}})$.
          Thus $\text{ev}_{\overline{a}}$ factors through a surjective map $\overline{\text{ev}}_{\overline{a}}\colon k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]/I \to k$ such that $\text{ev}_{\overline{a}} = \overline{\text{ev}}_{\overline{a}} \circ \pi$ where $\pi$ is the projection $\pi\colon k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}] \to k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}] / I$.
          In $k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}] / I$, since $x_{i} = a_{i}$ for all $i$, we have that $f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) = f(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n})$.
          Thus we have that $\pi(f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n})) = \pi(f(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}))$ for all $f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) \in k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$.
          Thus, every element of $k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}] / I$ is equal to $\pi(z)$ for some $z \in k$.
          However, for $z \in k$ we have that $z = \text{ev}_{\overline{a}}(z) = \overline{\text{ev}}_{\overline{a}}(\pi(z))$.
          In particular, this implies that $\overline{\text{ev}}_{\overline{a}}(\pi(z)) = 0$ if and only if $z = 0$.
          Thus, the kernel of $\overline{\text{ev}}_{\overline{a}}$ is $\pi(0) = 0$.
          Thus, $\overline{\text{ev}}_{\overline{a}}$ is an isomorphism and $I = \ideal{x_{1} - a_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} - a_{n}}$ is maximal.
    \item Since $\R[x]$ is a principal ideal domain, any ideal $I$ strictly containing $\ideal{x^{2} + 1}$ is of the form $\ideal{g(x)}$ for some $g(x) \mid x^{2} + 1$.
          However, since $x^{2} + 1$ is irreducible in $\R[x]$, we have that $g(x)$ is either $z(x^{2} + 1)$ for some nonzero $z \in \C$ or $g(x) = z$ for some nonzero $z \in \C$, meaning $\ideal{g(x)} = \ideal{x^{2} + 1}$ or or $\ideal{g(x)} = \R[x]$.
          Thus, $\ideal{x^{2} + 1}$ is maximal.
          However, in $\C[x]$, we have that $x^{2} + 1 = (x + i)(x - i)$ and so $\ideal{x^{2} + 1} \subsetneq \ideal{x - i} \subsetneq \C[x]$.
  \end{enumerate}
