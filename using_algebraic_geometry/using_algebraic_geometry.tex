\chapter*{Preface}

At the time of writing this, I am starting my PhD at The Ohio State University.
Currently a large part of my interests in algebra are about algorithms as they relate to polynomials and algebraic geometry.
I've been doing a bunch of problems from \emph{Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms}~\cite{book:IVA}.
However,  it seems that \emph{Using Algebraic Geometry}~\cite{book:UAG} moves through the material faster as it assumes you know more algebra.
So I've moved onto working through this books as well as trying to comprehend Sturmfel's \emph{Algorithms in Invariant Theory}~\cite{book:AlgosInInvTheory}.
